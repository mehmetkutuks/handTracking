# Real-Time Hand Tracking with MediaPipe & OpenCV

This project demonstrates real-time hand tracking using Python, MediaPipe and OpenCV. It captures live video from your webcam, detects hands, visualizes landmarks, and calculates FPS.

- Real-time hand detection with MediaPipe

- Visualization of hand landmarks and connections

- Pixel-level coordinate conversion from normalized values

- FPS (Frames Per Second) calculation

- Custom landmark highlighting
